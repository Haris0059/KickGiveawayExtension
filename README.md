# Kick Giveaway Extension

This is a simple browser extension for running giveaways on the streaming platform Kick.com. The extension allows a streamer to set a keyword and an award for a giveaway. Viewers can then enter the giveaway by typing the keyword in the chat. The extension will collect all unique users who have entered and then randomly select a winner.
